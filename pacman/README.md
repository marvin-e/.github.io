#Pacman Factory

Produces a factory of Pacmen that bounce around the screen

Title of Project: Pacman Factory

Description: The project has two buttons on the top left of the screen. One is Add Pacman which adds a pacman per click to the screen. The other is start game which starts moving the bouncing pacmen on the screen. 

How to Run: To run the program just click on the 'Add Pacman' button to select the amount of Pacmen you'd like to start with and then click the 'Start Game' button.

Roadmap of future improvements: I might want to add more animation, maybe create more borders on screen, eventually probably even create a homebrew version of Pacman.
