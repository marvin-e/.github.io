# GitHubPages web address: marvin-e.github.io

Hi, this is a portfolio page with a few projects I've worked on, hosted on Github Pages.
I used HTML, CSS, and Javascript on the site.
I also used a few BootStrap Icons for the LinkedIn and Youtube links
The form is a javascript client side form, feel free to reach out to me through there.
