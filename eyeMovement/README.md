# Eye Movement
This program moves the eyes on the screen based on where the cursor is on the screen

Title of Project: Eye Movement Program

Description: There are two eyes on the screen, which are moved by the position of the cursor on the screen.

How to Run: The program starts automatically once the page loads. You could see the eyes move immediately depending on where the cursor is on screen.

Roadmap of future improvements: I might want to add zones where the eyes won't move, maybe add random areas that pop up and once clicked points are accumulated.
