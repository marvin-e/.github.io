# PATH-Train-Route

Displays a map with all of the stops of the PATH Train from Journal Square to 33rd Street in New York

Title of Project: PATH Train route

Description: This project presents all of the stops for one of the routes of the PATH train which connects New Jersey to New York. One improvement I made to the project was adding an image marker of Thomas the Tank engine.

How to Run: To run the program just click on the button on the top of the screen. To re-run the program, press the refresh button.

Roadmap of future improvements: I might want to add the other PATH train routes. I might want to integrate live schedules. Also cropping the marker image to not have a white background.
